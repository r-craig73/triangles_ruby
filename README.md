#### By Ron Craig, Russell Hofvendahl

## Description

Take as input three side lengths and return whether the result will be either an equilateral, isoceles, scalene or NO triangle.

## Specifications

1. Check if the three inputs are the same value (equilateral triangle).
  Example Input: 4, 4, 4
  Example Output: Equilateral triangle
2. Account for the possibility that words might have different cases but should still be anagrams
  * Example Input: Cat act
  * Example Output: anagrams
3. Check if the inputs are words
  * Example Input: ct ct
  * Example Output: not words
4. If phrases aren't anagrams, check whether they are antigrams
  * Example Input: cat dog
  * Example Output: antigrams
5. Account for multiple words being anagrams, antigrams, or not real words, disregarding spaces and punctuation
  * Example Inputs: "act case!" "cat aces."; "dog face" "bill inn"; "tc cat" "ct act"
  * Example Outputs: anagrams; antigrams; not words

## Setup/Installation Requirements

  1. install ruby 2.2.2
  2. install bundler gem (execute "gem install bundler")
  3. clone or download anagrams repository
  4. run bundler in repository (execute "bundle")
  5. run anagrams_script.rb (execute "ruby anagrams_script.rb")
    * if this does not work try updating the shebang ("#!/...") at top of script file with the absolute path to your ruby interpreter
  6. to test: run rspec in main folder (execute "rspec")
